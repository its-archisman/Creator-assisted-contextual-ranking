# Creator-assisted-contextual-ranking
#### Problem: Say we have a creator who has uploaded many videos on YouTube. What he just does is that, he submits a ranking of the videos, according to his preference. So, he  would like the higher ranked videos to be watched more than the lower ranked ones. But, we cannot really present the same ranking while recommending to a particular user. This is a contextual problem, since it depends on the present context with which we are dealing with. That is, a particular user will have a particular choice at a particular time.
